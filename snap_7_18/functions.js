//Write a function in JavaScript that takes a number and finds the sum of all
// unique positive factors of a number.
// (The factors of a number are all numbers that divide evenly into it.
// For example, the unique positive factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12,
// and the sum would thus be 28.)
